Everything you need to build a Solid project, powered by [`solid-start`](https://start.solidjs.com) and [`TypeScript`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Works with Vercel out of the box.

> **Note**: This template is based on [`solidjs/templates/ts`](https://github.com/solidjs/templates/tree/master/ts), but with some additional customisations.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
